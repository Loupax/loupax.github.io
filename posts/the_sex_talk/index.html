            <p>I think it is time we had the sex talk. Please have a seat. I will try to keep

<p>Ready?<br>
Ok.</p>
<p>Sex is like talking. When people want to make an idea they talk about it until
they reach a conclusion.</p>
<p>Sometimes they talk with themselves which is all fun and good but there&rsquo;s a limit on how
much you can get out of it.</p>
<p>Sometimes it involves one person surrounded by a crowd, which can be great if
the speaker is talented and engaging enough but it&rsquo;s more of a one way thing.</p>
<p>And <em>sometimes</em> groups gather so they can talk together, usually groups of
two but it can involve more people. For those cases, the term used to describe the act
is &ldquo;<em>to perform discourse</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Discourse is a magical act. It is how people give birth to, and raise, their
ideas and while that is the closest thing it has to a purpose, it is not confined by it.</p>
<p>Some people use discourse just for the fun of it and they do just fine; the connection
with another being can be it&rsquo;s own reward after all. Others do it only to spit their
idea in someone&rsquo;s face which of course can be very rude unless the other one is
into that.<br>
Some people care about the journey, some people focus on reaching a conclusion
as quickly and in as few words as possible.</p>
<p>Most people claim to be good at it, but almost all of them are liars. The world would be
a better place if everyone just came to peace with that and stopped treating discourse
like a competitive sport and accept the fact that, like in every other skill most
people are mediocre on it. That it can be good enough as long as all participants
are having fun.<br>
There&rsquo;s no need to make up stories about how you totally won that debate
against that girl from another town that nobody from your common circle happens
to know about. It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Another myth about discourse is that it awesome and great at all times, but
thats very far from the truth.
In reality the more enjoyable a discourse session is, the more likely it is for
all it&rsquo;s participants to be deeply ashamed about it afterwards.
You see, good discourse is not about showing off and flexing your oratory
muscles. Good discourse is about communication and exposing your beliefs naked
for everyone to see.
Good discourse is about starting with small prods on your partners mind to see
what makes them move, and once they open up letting them do the same to you.
And keeping doing this until your ideas become one, and with each word you fill
a gap on their head, with each word you accept their inner world into yours and
you keep exploring the concepts and then&hellip;</p>
<p>You reach a conclusion. Panting and satisfied. Maybe a bit dehydrated. Just
realizing that the words that came out of your mouth sounded dumb and silly,
maybe even disgusting and gross.
But it doesn&rsquo;t matter, because you allowed yourself to become vulnerable for
someone else.</p>
<p>And for this moment everything is good.</p>
